Way assignment grades are made:
    Each student is given a personality and skill in a certain subject.
    the math is:
        random number between student skill and 100
        The number is then added by 4 of the students personality traits and divided by 5 to get the average.
        To implement it to the grade it's the assignment grade plus current grade then divided by 2

Adding more later it's 12:10 AM and i'm tired
